Given two strings, 'S and 'T' with lengths 'M' and 'N', find the length of the 'Longest Common Subsequence'.
For a string 'str'(per se) of length K, the subsequences are the strings containing
characters in the same relative order as they are present in 'str,' but not
necessarily contiguous. Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying
from O to K.
Example :
Subsequences of string "abc" are:
bc, ac, abc.
(empty string), a, b, c, ab,
Sample Input 1 :
adebc
dcadb
Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation of the Sample Output 1 :
Both the strings contain a common subsequence 'adb', which is the longest common subsequence with length 3. 
Answer:
int lcs(string s, string t)
{
	int m = s.length();
    int n = t.length();

  
    int dp[m + 1][n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = 0;
        }
    }
	
    for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    
    return dp[m][n];
}
