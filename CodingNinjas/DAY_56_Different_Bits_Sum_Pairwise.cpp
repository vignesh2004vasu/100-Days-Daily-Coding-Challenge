You are given an arbitrary array â€¢arr' consisting of 'N' non-negative integers. You
need to find the sum of bit differences of all the pairs that can be formed in the
given array.
In simple words, let us define f(x, y) as the count of different bits at the same
position in the binary representations of two integers, x and y.
You need to find the summation of f over all possible values of x and y in the
input array I.e sum( f(arr[i], arrj])) for all O i < N and O j < N.
For Example :
f(2, 3) 1, as 2 -+ 0010 and 3 -+ 0011, only the last bit is different in both the
numbers, hence f(2, 3) is 1.
Sample Input 1 :
2
2
1 2
2
6 6
Sample Output 1 :
4
0
Explanation for Sample Input 1 :
Test Case 1:
All the possible pairs in the given array are:-
f(1, 1) - as both numbers are same, no. of bit differences is 0
f(1, 2) - 1 in binary is (0001) and 2 in binary is (0010). There are 2 bits which are different in both the numbers. Hence, no. of bit differences is 2.
f(2, 2) - as both numbers are the same, no, of bit differences is 0
f(2, 1) - same as (1, 2), hence no. of bit differences is 2.
Summing the above values (0+2+0+2) we get 4. Hence, the output is 4.

Test Case 2:
There is only one possible pair (6,6). As both the numbers are sum, the output is 0.
Sample Input 2 :
2
3 
1 3 5
4
4 6 7 8
Sample Output 2 :
8
26
Answer:
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
int countSetBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return count;
}

int differentBitsSumPairwise(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
    int totalSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
            int bitDifference = countSetBits(arr[i] ^ arr[j]);
            totalSum += bitDifference * 2; 
        }
    }
    return totalSum;
}
