You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

Answer:
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {

        int n=matrix.size();
        cout<<n;
         for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
            swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
        }
    }
    
   
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        reverse(matrix[i].begin(), matrix[i].end());
    }
        
    }
};
