Given two integers L, R, and digit X. Find the number of occurrences of X in all the numbers in the range (L, R) excluding L and R.

Example 1:

Input:
L=10, R=19, X=1
Output:
9
Explanation:
There are 9 1s (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18) in the numbers in the range (10,19).
Example 2:

Input:
L=18, R=81, X=9
Output:
7
Explanation:
There are 7 occurrences of the digit 9 in the numbers in the range (18,81).
Answer:
class Solution {
public:
    int countX(int L, int R, int X) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = L + 1; i < R; ++i) {
            int num = i;
            while (num > 0) {
                int digit = num % 10;
                if (digit == X) {
                    count++;
                }
                num /= 10;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
