Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.

Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.

 

Example 1:


Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
Example 2:


Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.

Answer:
class Solution {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        int n = path.length();
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {
            int tempX = x;
            int tempY = y;
            for(int j=i;j<n;j++) {
                char ch = path.charAt(j);
                if(ch == 'N') 
                    y++;
                else if
                    (ch == 'S')
                         y--;
                else if
                    (ch == 'W')
                         x--;
                else
                     x++;
                if
                    (x == tempX && y == tempY)
                         return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
